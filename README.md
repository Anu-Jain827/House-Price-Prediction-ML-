# House-Price-Prediction-ML-
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. 

This project aims to (using Decision Tree and Random Forest Machine Learning Algorithms) predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
